## About me

I am currently an adjunct professor at the Deaprtment of Mathematics & Compuer Science, [**University of St Thomas**](https://www.stthom.edu). I finished my PhD in Mathematics at the Deaprtment of Mathematics, [**University of St Houston**](https://www.uh.edu/nsm/math/) under the advisement of [Andreas Mang](https://www.math.uh.edu/~andreas/) and [Yunhui He](https://www.math.uh.edu/~yhe43/). My research focuses on numerical methods for **inverse problems** and **optimal control**. Currently, I’m developing efficient solvers for large-scale optimization problems, with a particular interest in diffeomorphic image registration. My work involves studying optimal control problems governed by **transport equations** and designing **multigrid preconditioners** for the reduced space Hessian in **Newton-Krylov frameworks**. My broader interests include scientific computing, numerical linear algebra, and applications of mathematics to imaging and data science. I have served as the student advisor and president of the [UH chapter of AWM](https://uhawm.wordpress.com) (Association for Women in Mathematics).
