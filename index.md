## About me

I am currently an **Adjunct Professor** in the Deaprtment of Mathematics & Compuer Science at [University of St. Thomas](https://www.stthom.edu). I earned my PhD in Mathematics from the Deaprtment of Mathematics at [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/nsm/math/), where I was advised by [Andreas Mang](https://www.math.uh.edu/~andreas/) and [Yunhui He](https://www.math.uh.edu/~yhe43/). My research focuses on numerical methods for **inverse problems** and **optimal control**. My PhD work involved studying optimal control problems governed by **transport equations** and designing **multigrid preconditioners** for the reduced space Hessian in **Newton-Krylov frameworks** and developing efficient solvers for large-scale optimization problems, with a particular interest in diffeomorphic image registration. My broader research interests include scientific computing, numerical linear algebra, and applications of mathematics to imaging and data science. I have also been actively involved in academic service, serving as the student advisor and president of the [UH chapter of AWM](https://uhawm.wordpress.com) (Association for Women in Mathematics).
