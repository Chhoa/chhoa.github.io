## About me

I am a final-year PhD student in the Mathematics Department at **University of Houston**. I am part of the [SCOPA](https://scopagroup.github.io) (Scientific Computing, Optimization, and Parallel Algorithms) lab working under the advisement of [Andreas Mang](https://www.math.uh.edu/~andreas/) and [Yunhui He](https://www.math.uh.edu/~yhe43/). My research focuses on numerical methods for **inverse problems** and **optimal control**. Currently, I’m developing efficient solvers for large-scale optimization problems, with a particular interest in **diffeomorphic image registration**. My work involves studying optimal control problems governed by transport equations and designing **multigrid preconditioners** for the reduced space Hessian in **Newton-Krylov frameworks**. My broader interests include scientific computing, numerical linear algebra, and applications of mathematics to **imaging** and **data science**. I currently serve as the student advisor of the [UH chapter of AWM](https://uhawm.wordpress.com) (Association for Women in Mathematics), where I previously served as president.
